A skills test is an assessment test used to evaluate the skills and abilities of job candidates. These tests are designed to determine if a job applicant has the necessary skills to perform the various aspects of a job. In some cases, employers may even ask their existing employees to take this test. Primarily, however, a skills assessment test happens during the hiring process, where questions are designed as per the responsibilities to be performed in the open job position. The primary purpose of using these tests is to shortlist the right candidates for a job interview1.
